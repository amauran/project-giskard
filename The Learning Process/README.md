# Project Giskard -- The Learning Process

These are the tests I made while learning how things work :)

1) *Old login test*
    - the first few login test using a real site, as the test site was not yet set up
2) *Login test*
    - the first login tests with the *Happy Robot Shop*, our test site for this project
3) *Selector tests*
    - learning about CSS selectors and testing them in Robot Framework
4) *Simple cart test*
    - first tests using the shopping cart (adding and removing items)
5) *Emptying cart test*
    - a more developed version of the shopping cart test
    - Login, add items to cart, empty cart
6) *User keywords test*
    - learning about making user defined keywords, and how to write them in an external resource file
7) *Selenium vs. Browser keywords*
    - learning about how keywords differ in Selenium vs Browser libraries
    - started creating wrappers for both, so the test could be run without the need to switch keywords when switching between Selenium or Browser
8) *Order handling test*
    - building the final test set to base the portfolio on
    - **the aim was for the test to be able run either on Selenium or Browser, and you can switch between libraries with a single variable**


The final results of my learning can be found in the [Portfolio](https://github.com/amauran/project-giskard/tree/main/Portfolio).
