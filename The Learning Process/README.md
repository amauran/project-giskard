# Project Giskard -- The Learning Process

These are the tests I made while learning how things work :)

1) Old login test
    - the first few login test using a real site, as the test site was not yet set up
2) Login test
    - the first login tests with the Happy Robot shop, our test site for this project
3) Selector tests
    - learning about CSS selectors and testing them in Robot Framework
4) Simple cart test
    - first tests using the shopping cart (adding and removing items)
5) Emptying cart test
    - a more developed version of the shopping cart test
    - Login, add items to cart, empty cart
6) User keywords test
    - learning about making user defined keywords, and how to write them in an external resource file
7) Selenium vs. Browser keywords
    - learning about how keywords differ in Selenium vs Browser libraries
    - started creating wrappers for both, so a test could be run with a single set of user defined keywords, with the ability to switch between libraries with a single variable
8) Order handling test
    - building the final test set to base the portfolio on
    - test can be run on Selenium or Browser


The final results of my learning can be found in the [Portfolio](https://github.com/amauran/project-giskard/tree/main/Portfolio).
