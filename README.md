# Project Giskard

Anne learns Robot Framework

This project covers what I have learned about Robot Framework. Prior to this my only experience in programming was completing a basic course of Python, which helped in understanding a bit more about how programming languages work.

You can find the timetable of the process in the
[Weeklies](https://github.com/amauran/project-giskard/wiki/Weeklies) section, that will explain in more detail how things progressed.

The project [Wiki](https://github.com/amauran/project-giskard/wiki) also contains a lot of other bits and pieces learned along the way, including how we set up the [work environment](https://github.com/amauran/project-giskard/wiki/Setting-up-the-work-environment) and the [test environment](https://github.com/amauran/project-giskard/wiki/Setting-up-the-target-environment).

The [Portfolio](https://github.com/amauran/project-giskard/tree/main/Portfolio) contains the results of my learning so far, but hopefully the journey has only just begun :)
